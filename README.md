# Kanban Board Made With React
A simple board with drag and drop feature, made with React and a drag and drop library.
Made within 2 hours as part of an interview challenge.

Note: Data is static and cards are not persistent (i.e card will go back to initial position once refreshed). Neither does it have a backend, nor is it responsive.
